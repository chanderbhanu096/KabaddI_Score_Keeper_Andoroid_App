# KabaddI_Score_Keeper_Andoroid_App
## What is Kabaddi?
Kabaddi is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players each. ... 
Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled, but are brought 
back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle. It is popular 
in the Indian Subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries

## Purpose of the Project:
I developed this app for match who calculates their scores fouls and scores on paper to do the same on the mobile applications instead of blank for enviroment "Save Trees Save Enviroment" this way paper use may be reduced.
## Interface Of the Application
Interface of this app is simple. Screen is divided into two pars horizontaly. And adding scores to both the teams is super easy.
